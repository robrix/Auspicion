Builder:
- in call:, determine the number of arguments from the arity of the function.
	- require nil termination for varargs functions.

Compiler:
- implement static compilation.
	- include cross-compilation.

Module:
- in the presence of block support, implement -functionWithName:type:implementationBlock: which takes as its last parameter a block which takes a function and a builder.
	This will get the function if it exists, and if not will create it with the block.
